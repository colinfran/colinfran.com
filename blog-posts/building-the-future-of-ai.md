In January 2024, I joined HP as a full-stack software engineer, and I've been fortunate to work on an exciting new project: **Z by HP AI Studio**. This platform is designed to make AI and machine learning development more powerful and accessible, bringing together the best of HP's hardware and cutting-edge software.

**Z by HP AI Studio** leverages a modern tech stack - **Wails**, **Golang**, **React.js**, and **TypeScript** - to deliver a seamless experience for AI professionals. Whether you're training complex models or deploying AI solutions, this platform is optimized for performance and collaboration.

Working on this project has been an incredible journey, allowing me to deepen my skills and contribute to a product that's set to redefine AI development. If you're in the AI space, I highly recommend exploring what **Z by HP AI Studio** has to offer.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting venture!
